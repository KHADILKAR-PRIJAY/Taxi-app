- Users can create ride offers or request rides from others, and the app will suggest potential matches based on factors such as location, destination, and schedule. 
- After successfully booking the trip can view booking status (i.e: accepted/rejected/pending) on their status screen.
- Riders can delete the previous trip or edit the details regarding any changes.
